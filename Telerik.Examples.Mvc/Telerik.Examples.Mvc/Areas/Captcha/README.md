## Sample Overview
This area demonstrates how to integrate a Telerik Captcha component in ASP.NET MVC to prevent automated submissions. The sample includes server-side generation and validation of captcha images and audio, user input models, and AJAX-based refresh and validation endpoints. It provides a secure and user-friendly way to add anti-bot protection to forms.

# Telerik.Examples.Mvc

This repo contains a collection of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC examples. They are located in the Area folder of the project for convenience to the user. The provided samples:

- Demonstrate frequently asked questions, features, and scenarios.
- Are not part of our testing procedures and should be regarded as a knowledge base. 
- Might contain custom implementations which can be changed or integrated built-in with future release versions of the Product.

**DISCLAIMER:** The samples are for demonstration purposes only.

To run projects from this repository:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the Telerik.Examples.Mvc.sln file in Visual Studio.
3. Clean the solution.
4. Restore any missing NuGet packages.
5. Build the solution and run the project.

## Adding New Examples

To add a new sample, you can 

1. Create a new Area which will contain all the necessary files. The Naming of the sample should follow this logic:

![naming](Telerik.Examples.Mvc/Telerik.Examples.Mvc/Images/readme-images/naming.png)

2. Delete the web.config file and Views/Shared folder as they are optional.
3. Alternatively, you can copy another working Area and do mass-renaming.
4. It is important to apply namespaces to the Controllers and Models of the example so the classes do not become ambiguous, e.g. Telerik.Examples.Mvc.Areas.GridSelectionByField.Models
5. If you are adding an example with database, ensure that you change the EF model class names, but not the collection names:

![model-browser](Telerik.Examples.Mvc/Telerik.Examples.Mvc/Images/readme-images/model-browser.png)

And then you can add new Entity definition to the Web.config like this:

```
	 <add name="GridEditingInLineDatabaseEntities" connectionString="metadata=res://*/Areas.GridEditingInLineDatabase.Models.SampleModel.csdl|res://*/Areas.GridEditingInLineDatabase.Models.SampleModel.ssdl|res://*/Areas.GridEditingInLineDatabase.Models.SampleModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string='Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;attachdbfilename=|DataDirectory|\Sample.mdf;integrated security=True;connect timeout=30;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework'" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
```
